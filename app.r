For example, Women of color are more likely than White women to lack health insurance and have adequate access to healthcare. This lack in universal healthcare not only contributes to the misrepresentation of data but also less diagnosis of Women of Color and hence, higher fatality rates for Women of Color. It is important to address this issue of medical racism so these communities can prevail and provide adequate resources for all.
