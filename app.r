The lack of data collection, the misrepresentation and lack of representation downplays marginalized groups such as Women of color who suffer from diseases such as breast cancer. In a small dataset, we can still see that there are persisting racial disparities in our healthcare system today. For example, Women of color are more likely than White women to lack health insurance and have adequate access to healthcare. This lack in universal healthcare not only contributes to the misrepresentation of data but also less diagnosis of Women of Color and hence, higher fatality rates for Women of Color. It is important to address this issue of medical racism so these communities can prevail and provide adequate resources for all. There are many other factors that this dataset doesn't show such as the many different factors such as their environment that gives Women of color a predisposition to developing cancer and therefore dying earlier."),
