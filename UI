The lack of data collection, the misrepresentation and lack of representation downplays marginalized groups such as Women of color who suffer from diseases such as breast cancer. In a small dataset, we can still see that there are persisting racial disparities in our healthcare system today. For example, Women of color are more likely than White women to lack health insurance and have adequate access to healthcare. This lack in universal healthcare not only contributes to the misrepresentation of data but also less diagnosis of Women of Color and hence, higher fatality rates for Women of Color. It is important to address this issue of medical racism so these communities can prevail and provide adequate resources for all. There are many other factors that this dataset doesn't show such as the many different factors such as their environment that gives Women of color a predisposition to developing cancer and therefore dying earlier. Using our map example once again, we can see that ccancer death rates are higher in states that have low accessibility to adequate health care such as many states in the south. We can see the higher trend of cancer death rates per 100,000 accumulate more darkly in the southern states. Places with stringent laws against adequate health care not only negatively affects marginalized groups but also pushes the idea that they don't need it, when they are the one's who need it the most. This relates to the interactive chart 2 where we looked at the diagnosis of White women vs WOC, which we saw an increase for White women but decrease for WOC as age increased. This is just one example of how our healthcare systems still hold racist beliefs/values"),
