Chart 3:
What this deviation plot looks at is the difference in tumor stages for white women and women of color with respect to if their status shows that 
theyâ€™ve passed  from cancer. If the bar chart shows a positive trend it shows that more white women have died compared to women of color for that tumor stage.
When the bar is going in a negative direction it shows that more women of color have died compared to white women for that tumor stage. We can see that for the 
first three tumor stages more women of color had died compared to white women. The fourth stage shows that more white women have died compared to women of color
but that would because most of the cases counted for this dataset died in the early stages causing white women in T4 to be compared to no other variable.
