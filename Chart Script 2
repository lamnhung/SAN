  What this bar chart looks  into is the difference in tumor stages for white women and women of color. The difference is calculated by subtracting the number
  of tumor cases for white and women of color When a bar is pointed upwards it shows that the tumor stage for white women is higher than black women. When the 
  bar faces downwards in a negative direction, it shows that the tumor stage cases for women of color is higher than white women. We can see that all stages 
  except for Stage 2 show that white women had higher case counts for those tumor stages.
