#Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?
#I downloaded the data from the National Cancer Institute. (NIH). (https://seer.cancer.gov/archive/csr/1975_2018/browse_csr.php?sectionSEL=1&pageSEL=sect_01_table.20)

#How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?
#The data was collected by the SEER Cancer Statistics Review. US mortality uses census data and calculates rates per 100,000. SEER 21 collects data from certain areas, but not as wide as US/CDC data.

#How many observations (rows) are in your data?
#The rows included in the data is cancer site and sex. The rows specify the type of cancer and sex of the person. It includes 24 types of cancers and each group counts the total people, female, and male. It has 72 rows in total. 

#How many features (columns) are in the data?
#There are four columns in the data: Cancer Site, Sex, Total United States, and SEER 21 Areas. Within Total US and Seer 21 Areas includes: total, white, black, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Hispanic.

#What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
#What group is disproprotionately affected by cancer?
#What group has the highest/lowest mortality rate?
#What is the rank of group from highest to lowest and lowest to highest by mortality rate?
#Is there a difference between male and female cancer mortality rates?
#Is there a group of people who are more affected by certian cancers?

#Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?
#I downloaded the data from kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dannellyz/cancer-incidence-totals-and-rates-per-us-county?resource=download

#How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?
#The data was collected from NIH's National Cancer Institutes State Cancer Profiles, notably their incidence tables. The data is about the State Cancer Profiles that offers a framework for uniformly describing the cancer burden in order to spur action, incorporate surveillance into cancer control strategy, define regions and demographic groups, and highlight health disparities. This dataset emphasizes on cancer sites where evidence-based control treatments are available. 

#How many observations (rows) are in your data?
#There are 3008 rows in this dataset.

#How many features (columns) are in the data?
#There are 11 columns in this dataset which include: US counties, incidence rate per 100k, average annual count, recent trends, five year incidence change rate, state FIPS, incidence rate per 100k low 95, incidence rate per 100k high 95, five year incidence change rate low 95, and five year incidence change rate high 95. 

What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
#Which county has the highest/lowest annual count of cancer diagnosis in the US?
#Which counties has had a falling trend movement over the past 5 years?
#Which counties has had a stable trend movement over the past 5 years?
#Which counties has had a rising trend movement over the past 5 years?

the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?

#The dataset I had found came from the SEER database and it on breast cancer statistics. SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) program provides information on cancer statistics from 19 different registeries that are located across the country. The aim of SEER is to work to reduce cancer burden amongst those living in the United States. Data from SEER is collected  routinely on patient demographics, primary tumor site and morphology, stage of diagonsis, and first course treatment. SEER had collected incidnece and survival rates for about 48 percent of the country and accounts for several demographics (White, African American, Hispanic, American Indian and Alaskan Native). This bladder cancer data was collected from those multiple registries and complied to include various race demographics and cancer progression.

How many observations (rows) are in your data?
# This dataset accounts for 4,205 observations/ rows on patients that have been diagonosed for breast cancer. 

How many features (columns) are in the data?

# There are 16 columns to this dataset (Age, Race, Martial Status, T Stage, N Stage, 6th Stage, Grade, A Stage, Tumor Size, Estrogen Staus, Progesteron Regional Node Examined, Regional Node Positive, Survival Months, and Status)

What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
# What are disaprities in Bladder Cancer between women of color and white women according to incidence rates given in the graph?
# What are disparties between white women and women of color according to the stage of diagnosis?
# What is the difference in mortality rate for white women and women of color?
# What disparites lay in N-Stage rates for women of color and white women?
# What disparites lay in the T-Stage rate for women of color and white women?
