Breast cancer in the first tumor stage (T1) is invasive; the cancer cells have damaged or invaded the normal surrounding breast tissues. IA and IB are the two subgroups of Stage 1. 

Stage IA often refers to invasive breast cancer with a tumor up to 2 cm in size, no lymph nodes affected, and no external spread of cancer outside the breast. Invasive breast cancer is also referred to as stage IB when there is no tumor in the breast but instead, tiny clusters of cancer cells measuring 0.2-2 millimeters are discovered in the lymph nodes. Additionally, if there are little clusters of cancer cells in the lymph nodes that are 0.2-2 millimeters in size, there may be a tumor in the breast that is less than 2 cm in size.

The axillary lymph nodes can be affected by the tumor, which has a diameter of less than 2 cm. The tumor may also range in size from 2 to 5 cm and have not spread to the axillary lymph nodes.

Stage IIIB often refers to invasive breast cancer that has advanced to the chest wall, breast skin, and/or produced edema or an ulcer. It may also have spread up to nine axillary lymph nodes or to lymph nodes close to the breastbone. Breast cancer that is inflammatory is regarded as being at least stage IIIB. The breast feels warm and may be swollen; cancer cells have spread to the lymph nodes; and they may be discovered in the skin. These are typical symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer.

Stage IIIC generally refers to invasive breast cancer in which there may be no symptoms of the disease or, if there is a tumor (it may be of any size) have spread to the chest wall and/or the breast skin, and have affected 10+ axillary lymph nodes, lymph nodes above or below the collarbone, axillary lymph nodes, or lymph nodes close to the breastbone.

T4c menas the tumor has spread to both the skin and chest wall. T4c means the tumor is now a inflammatrory carcinoma. T4 is pretty serious and likely results in a death sentence/a much lower survival rate.
